##Notes
~This repo is also for me to remind myself how to use bs4~

```
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
import helper_functions as hf
```
Imports necessary modules

```
# Get html code form arch linux news page
source = requests.get("https://archlinux.org/").text

# Parse the html code
soup = BeautifulSoup(source, "lxml")
```
Get html source code and make a bs4 object which uses lxml to parse the content

```
# Get news section from the html code
news_div = soup.find("div", id="news")
news_dict = {}
```
Returns a tag object
bs4_object.tag1.tag2 or bs4.object.find("tag") both returns tag object
bs4.find_all("tag") returns a tag_object which is wrapped as a list.

```
# From news section get all news and its respective link and add to dict
for news in news_div.find_all("h4"):
    news_dict[news.a.text] = "https://archlinux.org" + news.a["href"]
```
Iterate over the tag list object.

```
# Print the news
hf.print_news(news_dict, "\n")
```
Yea everyone knows what it would do.
